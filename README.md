**Project Title:Dataset Generation and Analysis of Phishing Attacks on the Ethereum Blockchain**

**Overview**
This project focuses on generating a dataset and conducting an in-depth analysis of phishing attacks on the Ethereum blockchain. By leveraging data from blockchain explorers like Etherscan, we will identify malicious addresses and extract key transaction patterns to understand how phishing scams operate within the Ethereum network. The insights from this analysis can help in detecting and mitigating fraudulent activities in ethereum network.

**Objectives**
Collect and preprocess Ethereum transaction data, including phishing-related addresses.
Analyze phishing attack patterns by studying transaction flows, gas usage, and token interactions.
Identify key indicators of fraudulent behavior using statistical methods and machine learning techniques.
Develop a dataset that can be used for further research in detecting phishing attacks on the blockchain.

	In the Final combined-1 dataset, the gas-related attribute calculations include both incoming and outgoing transactions(Total transcation). 

	In the Final combined-2 dataset, the gas-related attribute calculations include only outgoing transactions.

	The Final combined-3 dataset, contain all attribute(Final Combined-1+Final Combined-2) .
